# Australia's Housing Shortage Calculation

# # Overall method
# First we will calculate the number of homes physically present in Australia.
# Then we will calculate the number of homes needed to adequately house Australia's population.
# Then we will compare these numbers, to calculate whether we have more or less homes than we need.

# # Step 1: Calculate the number of homes physically present in Australia
# The starting point is the most recent census, as this is when the ABS does a rigorous count of all homes physically
# present in Australia. Note that this includes both occupied and unoccupied.
# Reference: https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/AUS
number_of_homes_2021_census = 10852208

# To calculate the number of homes physically present in Australia at the year ends of 2021, 2022 and 2023 we need to
# use construction and demolition data, as the 2026 census has not yet been held.
# The dwellings completed per quarter are taken from the ABS. These numbers are gross, ie not subtracting demolitions.
# Reference: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/building-and-construction/building-activity-australia/latest-release#data-downloads (Table 37)
gross_construction_2021 = 39051 + 47552 + 45601 + 46356
gross_construction_2022 = 36951 + 43896 + 45389 + 47694
gross_construction_2023 = 38678 + 42314 + 45257 + 49836

# Demolition data for 2021, 2022 and 2023 is not available, however the NHSAC published this for 2024.
# So as a best estimate, we will assume the demolition ratios in 2021-3 were the same as 2024
# In 2024, there were 177,000 gross constructions and 155,000 net constructions.
# Therefore, we can calculate the ratio of demolitions to constructions as (177000 - 155000) / 177000
# Reference: https://nhsac.gov.au/sites/nhsac.gov.au/files/2025-05/ar-state-housing-system-2025.pdf (PDF page 13)
demolition_ratio =  (177000 - 155000) / 177000
# We need to know the fraction of homes built that are additional to existing stock, which is calculated by 1 minus the demolition ratio
net_construction_ratio = 1 - demolition_ratio

# Convert quarterly gross dwellings completed data into annual net dwellings completed, aka annual net construction rate
net_construction_2021 = gross_construction_2021 * net_construction_ratio
net_construction_2022 = gross_construction_2022 * net_construction_ratio
net_construction_2023 = gross_construction_2023 * net_construction_ratio

# Based on these rates, calculate the number dwellings present in Australia at the end of each year
# Note that the 2021 census was held on August 10, which is 0.6 of the way through the year
year_end_dwellings_2021 = number_of_homes_2021_census + net_construction_2021 * 0.4
year_end_dwellings_2022 = year_end_dwellings_2021 + net_construction_2022
year_end_dwellings_2023 = year_end_dwellings_2022 + net_construction_2023

# For 2024, the NHSAC published the net construction data, which was 155,000.
# We will use this to calculate the number of homes in Australia on 30th June, 2024.
# Reference: https://nhsac.gov.au/sites/nhsac.gov.au/files/2025-05/ar-state-housing-system-2025.pdf (PDF page 13)
net_construction_2024 = 155000
number_of_dwellings_june_30th_2024 = year_end_dwellings_2023 + net_construction_2024 * 0.5

# # Step 2: Calculate the number of homes required to adequately accommodate the people in Australia

# The basic approach of all methods is to first calculate the number of required households.
# There are several types of households, such as a family with two parents and children living together, a single
# parent with children, or a shared house. Each type of household contains a different number of people.
# As each household occupies one home, this will determine the number of homes required.
# The number of households is calculated based on the age structure of the population, and the propensity of each age
# group to live in each type of household.
# Overall method reference:
# https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/household-and-family-projections-australia-methodology/2021-2046

# Therefore, the first step is to define the below variable, containing the age structure of the population.
# This variable contains the number of people in Australia from ages 1 to 100+, as of 30th June 2024.
# Reference: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/national-state-and-territory-population/latest-release#data-downloads
# Specifically, the table named: Population - Australia: Population at 30 June, by sex and single year of age, Aust.
